### Creating Custom Docker Image for [Service-Center](https://github.com/ServiceComb/service-center)

There is already a docker image in our dockerhub [repo](https://hub.docker.com/r/servicecomb/service-center/), you can use this to run the service-center in docker container.
```
docker run -d -p 30100:30100 servicecomb/service-center
```

However if you want to customize the service-center and make your own docker image then follow the steps below. By default we use `quay.io/coreos/etcd` as our base image as we need etcd to be running before starting service-center, if you want to change the base image then you can change [here](scripts/docker/build-image/build.sh#L30).

##### 1. Make Sure your service-center is in correct GOPATH and then download all the dependencies
```
git clone https://github.com/ServiceComb/service-center.git $GOPATH/src/github.com/ServiceComb/service-center
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/ServiceComb/service-center

go get github.com/FiloSottile/gvt
gvt restore
```

##### 2. Run the build script to make the docker image
```
# cd scripts/docker/build-image/
# bash +x build.sh

##### 3. Run the docker image
```
# docker run -d -p 30100:30100 developement/servicecomb/service-center

# docker ps

##### 4. Verify the status of running container
```
# curl -v http://0.0.0.0:30100/health
* Hostname was NOT found in DNS cache
*   Trying 0.0.0.0...
