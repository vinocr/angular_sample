#### Make your Changes

If this is a bug or a small fix then you can directly make the changes and ensure all the steps in this documentation and raise a PR, but If it is a feature or a big design or architecture change then we recommend you to raise an issue [here](https://github.com/ServiceComb/service-center/issues) or discuss the same in our [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/servicecomb-developers).

#### Compile and running Test locally.

Once you are done with your changes then please follow the below checks to ensure the code quality before raising a PR.
```
go fmt ./...

go build -o service-center
```

Running UT in local env, this step assumes you have a docker running in your env.
```
bash -x scripts/ut_test_in_docker.sh 
```

Once UT has passed you can run the integration test to ensure the overall functionality is not altered.
```
bash -x scripts/integration_test.sh
```

#### Pushing the Code and Raising PR

Once you are done with compiling, UT and IT then you are good to go for raising the PR, please follow these [guidelines](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) for raising the PR.
